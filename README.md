### Project Title: *Offline Capability Enhancement - Talawa Mobile*

**Organization**: *The Palisadoes Foundation*  
**Mentor**: *Md Noman Khan, Jason Odoom*  

---

## Problem Statement

- **Initial Limitations**:
  - Talawa previously lacked robust offline handling capabilities.
  - The app did not have an efficient caching system, leading to limited functionality without a stable network connection.
  - Without the internet, Talawa behaved inconsistently, displaying loading indicators across screens and allowing no other actions.
  - If launched offline, the application was barely usable, and some situations even led to app crashes.

- **Primary Goals**:
  - Strengthen Talawa’s offline support to handle offline scenarios gracefully.
  - Introduce an efficient caching mechanism to the mobile application.
  - Integrate the chat feature to enhance the application’s usability and interaction capabilities.
