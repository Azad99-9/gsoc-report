### Project Title: *Offline Capability Enhancement - Talawa Mobile*

**Organization**: *The Palisadoes Foundation*  
**Mentor**: *Md Noman Khan, Jason Odoom*  

---

## Problem Statement

- **Primary Goals**:
  - Strengthen Talawaâ€™s offline support to handle offline scenarios gracefully.
  - Introduce an efficient caching mechanism to the mobile application.

- **Previous Limitations**:
  - Talawa previously lacked robust offline handling capabilities.
  - The app did not have an efficient caching system, leading to limited functionality without a stable network connection.

- **Proposed Solutions**:
  - **Offline Actions Feature**:
    - Develop a feature to handle user actions when offline, allowing users to perform actions that sync automatically when back online.
    - Integrate this feature with existing app functionalities (e.g., liking posts, creating events), providing a seamless experience similar to popular social media platforms like Instagram and WhatsApp.
  
  - **Caching Mechanism**:
    - Implement a caching system that complements offline actions, ensuring that:
      - User actions performed offline are stored until they can be synced.
      - Frequently accessed data (e.g., feed, messages) is cached to reduce loading times and improve usability in low-connectivity situations.

- **Objective for User Experience**:
  - Deliver a smooth, uninterrupted experience for users, even during inconsistent network conditions, making Talawa a reliable and user-friendly application.
